                    excellent money. But as with all expanding markets care is needed to make sure you make the right
                    moves at the right time. </p>

                    from the very start. </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">What are Cryptocurrency Affiliate Marketing Programs?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Before we proceed and look at some crypto affiliate tips it is worth just clarifying exactly what we
                    mean. By now we have all heard of cryptocurrency, think Bitcoin if you’re not sure. And we all know
                    about affiliate marketing schemes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Put the two together and you have a basic understanding of what we are talking about.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital asset, there are many different types or coins. We mentioned Bitcoins
                    already, but other popular ones include: -</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Zillica</li>
                    <li>Ethereum</li>
                    <li>Dogecoin</li>
                    <li>XRP (Ripple)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Together these two elements form the core of Crypto Affiliate programs. </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">How do Cryptocurrency Affiliate Programs Work?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Now we understand the concepts of the scheme, let’s look and see how they work. As with any affiliate
                    scheme the goal is for companies to drive crypto traffic towards their product using affiliate
                    marketing as the tool. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Once a buyer purchases the product using an affiliate link the affiliate receives their payment. This
                    could be in cryptocurrency or in fiat currency, such as Dollars or Euros, the amount they are paid
                    depends on the scheme. Some schemes pay a flat fee and others pay on a commission basis. </p>

                    tips if you are considering becoming a bitcoin marketing affiliate. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Bitcoin is the best known of all cryptocurrencies, whilst this may not make it the most lucrative of
                    platforms for earning top dollar, it does offer more security than newer and less established
                    platforms. But there are still a few things to watch out for. </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Using Push and Pop Traffic</p>
                <br>
                <p>Increasingly Affiliates from all Niches are using push traffic to increase conversions and retain
                    visitor’s interest. Making money flow funnels in crypto vertical works better with this type of
                    traffic as the specific audience is looking for easy earning methods.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For instance: make money funnel with an email submit button on your landing page. Where it clearly
                    describes the scheme of earning money.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Use Push and Pop Notifications in Crypto Vertical</p>
                <br>
                <p>A cheap and extremely effective way of pushing your message to a highly targeted audience.</p>
                <p>The first thing in this section is what not to do! People soon get tired of constant pop ups and
                    reminders. Be careful not to ‘Spam’ as people will soon get tired of this. </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Special offers and limited time deals – These are a great way of letting people know of any
                        offers you are running.</li>
                    <li>New Content – Draw visitors back to your site by informing them of new content.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Used correctly Push personalized Notifications are incredibly effective, used wrongly you will soon
                    have people turning away. It is essential to properly balance how you use these incredibly powerful
                    tools. </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Creatives Tips </p>
                <br>
                <p>The main goal of creatives in push notifications is to attract the user’s attention.</p>
                <p>Make your creatives based on type of potential clients:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>users who are in the loop of crypto topic;</li>
                    <li>users who are looking for easy ways of earning money.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>For the first type you can use some data info or stats images and statements like “Get Tips For
                    Better Trading” or “Get a Trading Consultation from an Expert” as we mentioned before.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the second one use catchy images of bitcoin icons or customized money icons, money or any luxury
                    elements like yachts, expensive cars etc. combining with images of ordinary people. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Use ad copies with a statement like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        “You can easily earn this amount of money in a short period.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Australians make money online using this scheme.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Know the secret of making $1000 online.”
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Write real amounts of money to connect the audience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For pop traffic, use colorful images with buttons like “register” or “take my money”. Also, a good
                    method is two-pages funnels with an email submit button on the first page like: “Get Tips For Better
                    Trading” or “Get a Trading Consultation from an Expert.” etc. for customers who are familiar with
                    the topic of cryptocurrencies. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Creatives serve as a first touch with the user, so they need to be intriguing. The landing page that
                    goes after the banner must be relevant to the creative you use. Otherwise, the user may be confused.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits of Push and Pop Traffic</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cost. This type of traffic is not as expensive compared to others;</li>
                    <li>Very noticeable;</li>

                    cryptocurrency just as much as it applies to fiat currencies. There are some obvious steps you can
                    take to protect yourself from scammers including: </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check the Reputation of the Scheme you are considering – This is common sense no matter what
                        niche your affiliate marketing scheme is working within, but particularly relevant in the
                        emerging niche of cryptocurrency. </li>
                    <li>Conversion Rate – We all know how volatile Cryptocurrency values are. Many dubious schemes will
                        change the value of your commission downwards when it suits them, but never upwards. In cases
                        like this your $20 commission could be halved, ensure that your commission is locked at the rate
                        when the purchase was made. </li>
                    <li>Withheld Commission Payments – This is the most frequent scam and can simply be avoided by
                        following the first point on this list. Many dodgy schemes will simply not pay the commission
                        that is owed to you. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>The ever-expanding market that is cryptocurrency is here to stay and this is a perfect time to get in
                    on the ground floor and become a player in this niche. </p>
