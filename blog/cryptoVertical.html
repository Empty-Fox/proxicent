            <div class="text-block-3 paragraph">
                <p>The Crypto vertical established itself as the most profitable one in affiliate marketing and
                    straightened its positions in 2020. When the stay-at-home lifestyle compelled people to look for
                    different sources of income. Many turned to cryptocurrencies, and now the crypto vertical is
                    considered to be a gold mine for affiliate marketers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Continuing with the series of articles related to a crypto topic, this one is devoted to traffic
                    sources and trending crypto funnels. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The interest in the crypto niche is mainly driven by high payouts and the possibility of prepayment,
                    the ability to target a broad audience and choose a wide range of GEOs. Only on the surface, crypto
                    seems to be an easy niche to master, but here are some severities you might stumble on at the very
                    beginning:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial entry barrier.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Crypto might be expensive to test. Campaigns usually have to spend much more before seeing any
                    conversions</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ban issues.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Applicable when you use Facebook as the traffic source, it is famous for its «ban first ask questions
                    later» policy.</p>
                <br>
                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">According to SimilarWeb: </span>In January 2018, Facebook
                    announced that it was banning ads for some financial products and services including “initial coin
                    offerings, or cryptocurrency”. Later Google announced that, as of June 2018, they would no longer
                    serve ads for “cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin
                    offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice)“.
                    Despite this tightening of restrictions from the two biggest advertising platforms, there is little
                    chance that this will have a major impact on the flow of traffic to the top cryptocurrency exchange
                    sites.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Marketing flows</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>You have to take your time before you find your profitable marketing flow: creatives and pre-landers.
                    The quality of lending - the localizations, quality of design, and content availability.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Types of crypto offers:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Autotrading;</li>
                    <li>Trading;</li>
                    <li>Investments;</li>
                    <li>Crypto Education.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Trending Funnels for Autotrading type of offer:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bitcoin Revolution;</li>
                    <li>Bitcoin Profit;</li>
                    <li>Bitcoin Future;</li>
                    <li>Bitcoin Era;</li>
                    <li>Bitcoin Pro.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>If you are just starting your affiliate journey, your traffic type should be in line with offer
                    requirements. Knowing what you need is the key to selecting the best traffic source for you. Here
                    you can find a list of types of traffic sources that work well for the crypto vertical.</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>SEO
                        <br>
                        <p> As we mentioned in our previous article «How to succeed in the crypto vertical» SEO Traffic
                            is a fantastic method for the crypto vertical to gain more conversions. These could be
                            crypto-educating sources like info webpages for crypto trading. The approximate monthly
                            budget for one site and one specific geo would be $1500.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For example, a webpage with crypto articles and news including the offer link. This type of
                            traffic works well as the audience is specified and highly targeted. </p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Google search
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Search traffic is also a good method for these types of campaigns, and it can be more
                            effective if you mix it with contextual. Search traffic brings higher quality in the
                            mid-term, and contextual traffic provides you with the target audience by paying for the
                            keywords related to your content and quickly sending the traffic to your site.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>People usually tend to ask search engines disturbing questions.</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>«How to get rich?»</li>
                            <li>«How to earn money online?»</li>
                            <li>«Money online fast»</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>And more specified questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>«Where to exchange cryptocurrency»</li>
                            <li>«Trading crypto assistant/bot»</li>
                            <li>«Crypto Trading strategies»</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            So why not advertise your matching product at the top of those answers? Your offer may look
                            like one of those answers.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Facebook
                        <br>
                        <p>Social platforms are becoming more and more regulated and restrictive with the content they
                            show.
                            Despite this, Facebook Ads can be your best ally thanks to a billion carefully researched
                            users, the Facebook pixel, and the remarketing opportunities that will send you continuously
                            new leads by displaying your products to the best audience segmentation. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>But this traffic type needs some tools to start: proxy, cloaking tool, anti detect browser,
                            etc. It also has a significant barrier: ban issue. So you have to come up with the right
                            marketing flow.</p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Push/Pop-under/click under
                        <br>
                        <p>Cheap traffic type. You can run various offer types using this traffic. But usually from
                            generic verticals, like ‘nutra’ or ‘dating’. Requirements for the crypto vertical are more
                            specific, so you should select a more tailored type of traffic. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Making money flow funnels in the crypto vertical works better with this type of traffic as
                            the specific audience is looking for easy earning methods.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For instance: make a money funnel with an email submit button on your landing page. Where it
                            clearly describes the scheme of earning money. </p>
                        <p>Funnels with financial opinion leaders also work well.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Also, a good method is two-pages funnels with an email submit button on the first page like
                            “Get Tips For Better Trading” or “Get a Trading Consultation from an expert” etc.</p>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Native
                        <br>
                        <p>Native ads can do a great job with Trading and Crypto campaigns thanks to the variety of
                            simple and attractive ad formats widely available. Native ads require having a lot of good
                            content. After all, they are almost like an actual article. The distinction is coming from
                            the goal of this content, not from its quality. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Newsbreaks - “old-but-gold” method to promote anything when it comes to whatever everyone is
                            talking about. It works really well for this type of traffic.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For instance: “Earning on Phizer Stock investment - Multiple strategies” or something else
                            like coronavirus vaccines topics etc.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Make your creatives look like actual articles.</p>
                        <p>Ad copies like these below work well for crypto vertical: </p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Bitcoin trading is the fastest way to make money online”</li>
                            <li>“I received a check for 4500 for the first two weeks”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Use catchy images of money or regular people with some amount of money to connect the
                            audience.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Now as you are aware of different traffic types and trending crypto funnels pick up the best
                            offer and start your affiliate crypto journey! </p>
